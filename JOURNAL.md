**Total Time Spent**:

## ~May-July 14: Research

**Time Spent**: ~8 hours

- Researched split keyboards, specifically Lily58 and Corne layouts.
- What I wanted in a keyboard/use, if I wanted a track pad, rotatory knob, leds etc.
- At the same time learned about, how to use and created a layout on Ergogen, and starting on the pcb. (although later this was just used for key layout due to the amount of custom parts being used)
- Came up with a list and created a google doc to document everything found and what needs to be worked on.
- Compared and contrasted if I wanted a oled or nice!view epaper screen, with RGB to figure out battery life (just decided to go with nice!view and per key RGB and potentially 4000-2000mAh battery to also add weight)
- Also decided to go with MX switch footprint instead of choc, due to mx's superior sound and I'm not ready to commit fully to choc switches
- Found more specific parts such as the TPS65 Touchpad, ANO rotary wheel and comparing that to models such as the cirque track pad, and conventional knobs

- Created onshape to continue to mess with the layout and the dimensions of the new parts

**NOTE**: I started doing early planning, and researching part on and off throughout march, early july due to other commitments, but majority of design and firmware development is happening in July (from now on).

## July 15: True Beginning

**Time Spent**: ~2 (so far)
